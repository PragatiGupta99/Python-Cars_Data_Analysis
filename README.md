# Python-Cars_Data_Analysis
This data is available in csv format. In this project we have to solve some questions with the help of python libraries.

The commands that we used in this project:
1. import pandas as pd
2.  pd.read_csv
3.  head()
4.  shape
5.  fillna()
6.  isnull()
7.  apply() etc.

This project contains:
1. data cleaning: Find all the null values in the dataset. If there is any null value in any column, then fill it with the mean of that column.
2. Questions: Check what are the different types of make are there in our dataset. And, what is the count of each make in the data.
3. Data Filtering: Filter all the data.
4. Removing unwanted column
